## Important Templates

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `front-page.php` | Homepage layout with latest posts |
| `page.php` | Default page template with Gutenberg content |
| `single.php` | Single blog post layout |
| `category.php` | Category archive layout |
| `archive.php` | General archive fallback |
| `page-about.php` | Custom About page built with HTML/CSS |
| `header.php` | Site header, logo, menu, search, hero widget area |
| `footer.php` | Footer widget columns and footer menu |
| `sidebar.php` | Main sidebar widget area |
| `comments.php` | Comments and reply form |
| `functions.php` | Theme setup, widget registration, hooks, AJAX handlers |

## Custom Widgets

The theme includes multiple custom widgets created with WordPress `WP_Widget` classes:

- `MeroTheme Sidebar Position`
- `MeroTheme Inner Page Hero`
- `MeroTheme Breadcrumb`
- `MeroTheme Search`
- `MeroTheme Social Links`
- `MeroTheme Popular Posts`
- `MeroTheme Recent Posts`
- `MeroTheme Categories`
- `MeroTheme Tags`
- `MeroTheme Footer Contact`
- `MeroTheme Footer About`
- `MeroTheme Newsletter`

These widgets can be managed from:

```text
Appearance > Widgets
```

## Sidebar Position

The sidebar position is controlled by the custom widget:

```text
Appearance > Widgets > MeroTheme Sidebar Position
```

Available options:

- Left sidebar
- Right sidebar

The selected value is used by the main templates to decide whether the sidebar should appear before or after the content.

## About Page

The About page uses a dedicated custom template:

```text
page-about.php
```

Unlike normal pages, this page is built using static HTML and CSS sections for:

- About content
- Skills
- Team members

Other pages and posts are designed to use Gutenberg editor content.

## ACF Usage

The theme includes ACF option page registration in:

```text
inc/acf-options.php
```

ACF is used for theme settings such as header, footer, social links, and back-to-top options.

Some unused ACF option pages are hidden from the dashboard menu to keep the admin panel cleaner.

## Post Likes

The theme includes an AJAX-based post like feature.

Main parts:

- Like button output in the single post template
- Like count stored in post meta as `post_likes`
- AJAX handler in `functions.php`
- JavaScript behavior in `assets/js/main.js`

The homepage displays the saved like count beside the thumbs-up icon.

```text
